Hello, Everybody. ljkadsflksadjflsakjdflsdf,msdnjksfd

My name is Sanjeev Kumar.
I like computers and have always been interested in learning a lot about them.

When I was introduced to computer programming, I wanted to learn all the computer languages. But then I was introduced to Data Structures and Algorithms. That was when I found computer programming difficult. So I prioritized DSA over computer languages.

Now I am trying hard at learning DSA but neither DSA nor computer languages nor college studies get my time because I spend the whole day and night playing Counter Strike : Global Offensive. And I am just a Silver Elite Master. Not even Gold Nova 1.

I also read comic books a lot, especially of DC.
